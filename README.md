🚀 To-Do List Web App
This project was developed as part of my internship at Rhombix Technologies. It is a full-fledged To-Do List Web Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to manage daily tasks with an intuitive and responsive user interface.

🛠️ Key Features:
- Add, edit, delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Persistent storage using localStorage
- Real-time task updates
- Mobile-responsive layout

This project helped me strengthen my skills in front-end web development, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive design. It was a part of my task assignments during the internship and showcases practical application of modern web development practices.
